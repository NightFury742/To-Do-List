# To-Do-List
A to-do list to jot down your daily tasks



I have made a simple web application that allows users to create a to-do list, save it in local storage, and display the list on the webpage. Users can mark items as done and remove them from the list.



## Technologies Used:

This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also utilizes the localStorage object to store the user's to-do list items.



## Setup:

Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.



## Functionality:

1.The user can type a task into the input field and click the "Add" button or press the "Enter" key to add it to the list.

2.The user can mark an item as done by clicking the "Done" button next to it. The item will be crossed out and its opacity will be reduced.

3.The user can remove an item from the list by clicking the "Remove" button next to it.

4.The list is saved in local storage so that the user's items persist between page reloads.

5.The application uses an IntersectionObserver to add a class to hidden elements when they are scrolled into view, creating a fade-in effect.

6.Used CSS animations to make the web app look more interactive
